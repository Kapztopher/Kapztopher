*This is intended to host webpages, circuit schematics and microcontroller code.  I accept NO RESPONSIBILITY for the use and construction of any design or code I publish,  USER BEWARE I DO NOT CARE!!!!*

### Circuit schematics

- Basic h-bridge designs
- Light array designs, centered around the use of ambient sound to control displays, (inlcudes flashing helmet for lupinos).
- **Basic** band_pass filter designs for graphic equaliser display.
- Inductor based circuits, buck and boost designs.
- PWM controllers ( Mostly simple 555 designs).
- Ardunio break_out boards

### Adrunio Code

- Simple RF designs.
- Attempts at making an IR signal reader, (reasonably effective "hashing" based signal interputation.
- NRF24L01 based RC transciever code.
- RC code based on simple and cheap 433MHz transmitter and reciever,  has data checking and works reliably over a range of a metre lol.


### Web page

- (https://kapztopher.github.io/Project_list/), a summary of things I have been up to project wise.  Has videos of progress and displays of design functionalities.
